            <h1>Blackjack rules</h1>
            <h2>BETTING</h2>
            <p>
                Before the deal begins, place a bet by clicking 
                + or - to add or remove $50 to your bet.
            </p>
            <h2>THE PLAY</h2>
            <p>
                The player goes first and must decide whether to "stand" (not ask for another card) 
                or "hit" (ask for another card in an attempt to get closer to a count of 21, or even hit 21 exactly). 
                Thus, a player may stand on the two cards originally dealt to them, or they may ask the dealer for 
                additional cards, one at a time, until deciding to stand on the total (if it is 21 or under), 
                or goes "bust" (if it is over 21). In the latter case, the player loses and the dealer collects 
                the bet wagered. <br/>
                The combination of an ace with a card other than a ten-card is known as a "soft hand," 
                because the player can count the ace as a 1 or 11, and either draw cards or not. For 
                example with a "soft 17" (an ace and a 6), the total is 7 or 17. While a count of 17 
                is a good hand, the player may wish to draw for a higher total. If the draw creates a 
                bust hand by counting the ace as an 11, the player simply counts the ace as a 1 and 
                continues playing by standing or "hitting" (asking the dealer for additional cards, one at a time).
            </p>
            <h2>DOUBLING DOWN</h2>
            <p>
                Another option open to the player is doubling their bet when the original two cards dealt total 
                9, 10, or 11. When the player's turn comes, they place a bet equal to the original bet, and the 
                dealer gives the player just one card, which is placed face down and is not turned up until the bets 
                are settled at the end of the hand.
